I have been dedicated to developing and maintaining this plugin for many years since the inception of Ionic Capacitor. Now, at 73+ years old, and with my MacBook Pro becoming obsolete for running Capacitor 6 for iOS, I have made the decision to cease maintenance of the plugin. If anyone wishes to take ownership of this plugin, they are welcome to do so.

It has been a great honor to be part of this development journey alongside the developer community. I am grateful to see many of you following me on this path and incorporating the plugin into your applications. Your comments and suggestions have motivated me to continuously improve it.

I have made this decision due to several family-related troubles that require my full attention and time. Therefore, I will not be stepping back. Thank you to all of you for your support.
